    misc

        Attempted to apply the rest of James' patches.  Got lots of error, but 
        where I checked they applied cleanly. Hopefully they all took.  
        The test set still seems to work.

    measurementFile.py

        Applied patches and fixed a (new?) bug in the code to strip out 
        STL (Structural Test Lab) labels from measurement sheets.

    reducePlot.py

	Applied James' patches here.


2011-08-04 reduce-2.2.4-jep02 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Simplified DataTrace.get_point(). 

2011-08-04 reduce-2.2.4-jep01 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Added delimiter argument to dataFile.tdd_split(), 
        to make it more general. 

        Added some comments. 

2011-08-04 reduce-2.2.3-bwh01 Bryan Harris

    setup.py

        Updated the version number to 2.2.4 and added tee.py to the modules.  
        Missing tee.py was a bug which would cause an install to fail.

2011-08-03 reduce-2.2.3-jep10 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Simplified tdd_split(). 

2011-07-29 reduce-2.2.3-jep09 James Prior

    rlo.py, dataFile.py, and reducePlot.py

        Started using more docstrings. 
        Added comments. 

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep08 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Changed value of ZERO_LOAD to 6 (from 3). 
        That got the program to generate correct plot images again, 
        but I don't know why the value of ZERO_LOAD can cause 
        such trouble. This warrants study. 

        Fixed magic number indexes to self.traces[]:
           0 --> self.TIME
           1 --> self.STROKE

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep07 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Fixed real ZERO_LOAD initialization bug (3 not [3]). 
        Fixed magic number indexes from 6 to ZERO_LOAD. 
        However using value of 3 for ZERO_LOAD (instead of 6) 
        causes generation of bad plot images. 

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep06 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Fixed harmless off by one bug for value of ZERO_LOAD
        (ZERO_LOAD has a new bad value of [3])

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep05 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Fixed harmless off by one bug for value of ZERO_LOAD

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep05 James Prior

    reducePlot.py

        Named a magic number: MAX_PLOT_POINTS = 500
        (ZERO_LOAD still has a bad value of [4])

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep04 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Renamed ZL --> ZERO_LOAD
        (and changed its value from 6 to [4], so this version does not work.)

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep03 James Prior

    measurementFile.py

        Cleaned up imports. 

2011-07-28 reduce-2.2.3-jep02 James Prior

    tee.py

        Slightly improved docstring for Tee class. 

2011-07-27 reduce-2.2.3-jep01 James Prior

    measurementFile.py

        Restored first line of long if statement. 

2011-07-27 reduce-2.2.3 Bryan Harris

    measurementFile.py

        Changed some indexes for where to look for 'Specimen ID'. 
        Deleted first line of long if statement. 

2011-07-27 reduce-2.2.2-jep12 James Prior

    dataFile.py, reducePlot.py, and measurementFile.py

        Directly make the plot images in the directory you want them to 
        ultimately be in, instead of making them in the current directory, 
        then moving them later. 

2011-07-27 reduce-2.2.2-jep11 James Prior

    measurementFile.py

        Refactored Specimen class. 

2011-07-27 reduce-2.2.2-jep10 James Prior

    measurementFile.py

        Removed ASCII CR (carriage return) characters. 

2011-07-26 reduce-2.2.2-jep09 James Prior

    measurementFile.py

        Modest refactorings of MeasFile class. 

2011-07-26 reduce-2.2.2-jep08 James Prior

    rlo.py and dataFile.py

        Miscellaneous refactorings. 

2011-07-26 reduce-2.2.2-jep07 James Prior

    dataFile.py

        Eliminated some get_*() and set_*() method calls by 
        converting them to direct attribute references, 
        since the moved code is now in a method of the object 
        that has the data. 

2011-07-26 reduce-2.2.2-jep06 James Prior

    rlo.py and dataFile.py

        Moved much code from rlo.py to 
        a new method of the DataFile_SL class in dataFile.py. 
        (This is just a first step in this move.)

2011-07-26 reduce-2.2.2-jep05 James Prior

    tee.py

        Updated docstrings. 

2011-07-25 reduce-2.2.2-jep04 James Prior

    rlo.py

        Redirected writes to stdout to go to both standard output 
        and a log file (without using ">>t," explicit redirection). 

2011-07-25 reduce-2.2.2-jep03 James Prior

    dataFile.py and rlo.py

        Mild low level reformatting of all code in these modules to 
        mostly follow PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code
        This also affected other modules, particularly for names.

        Slight refactoring of t=Tee code. 
        Flagged stuff for later attention with '!!!' in comments. 
        Low level miscellaneous refactorings. 

        Massive low level reformatting of all code in this module to 
        mostly follow PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code
        http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
        This also affected other modules, particularly for names. 

        Massive restructuring of code to call methods to access data 
        of objects instead of directly accessing them. 
        Initially, this makes the code uglier than it was. 
        However, when the code that wanted to use internal data of 
        ojects so much is moved into the class itself, 
        the code will become simple and pretty. 
        Until then things will look ugly. Please have patience.

        Fixed code to delete only lines that have stuff that can not

    rlo.py

        Iverted test of __name__ near top of file, so that following 
        code (which is most of the code) could be dedented one level.  
        That led to consolidating some statements onto a single line 
        which had been split across more than one line. 

        Redirected usage() output to standard error.

    rlo.py

        Fixes _possible_ bug. 

        Lines 219-221 has print statements that output only to 
        standard output, although neighboring print statements output 
        to both standard output and log_file via the >>t technique. 
        I do not know that this is a bug, but it smells like one, 
        so I added the ">>t, " stuff to those prints.

    rlo.py

        Simplified printing same stuff to multiple outputs. 
        Instead of having separate print statements for each output, 
        one now has only a single print statement for multiple outputs. 

        For example, the old way:

            print time.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", time.localtime())
            print "user:",os.times()[0],"s"
            print "system:",os.times()[1],"s"
            print >>log_file, time.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", time.localtime())
            print >>log_file, "user:",os.times()[0],"s"
            print >>log_file, "system:",os.times()[1],"s" 

        was simplified to: 

            t=Tee([sys.stdout,log_file])
        ...
            print >>t, time.strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000', 
                time.localtime())
            print >>t, 'user:', os.times()[0], 's'
            print >>t, 'system:', os.times()[1], 's' 

    tee.py

        Created.  Simplifies writing to multiple files. 

        Instead of repeating a print for each file one needs to output to, 
        one uses a single print that redirects to an instance of this class.  

        Inspired by Unix tee program.

2011-07-21 reduce-2.2.0-jep01 James Prior

    rlo.py

        Refactored code that created reduce_path and image_path 
        directories, and checked to see if those directories are 
        writable. 

        This included the elimination of a redundant test of ability 
        to write to reduce_path directory, which led to big dedent 
        of following code and subsequent unwrapping of some statements 
        which had previously been split across more than one line. 

        Error messages were made more accurate and meaningful. 
        Old error message was about not being able to read, 
        even though the test was about writing to the directory. 
        The error message was changed to be about writing. 

        Catches directory creation error and generates error 
        message and sys.exit()s instead of crashing in Python interpreter. 

        Redirected messages about fatal errors to sys.stderr. 

        Instead of the xlrd-0.7.1 that is bundled with reduce, 
        I used the older version 0.6.1-2 of the python-xlrd package 
        that was avaiable for Bodhi linux 1.1.0. reduce seemed to 
        work with the older 0.6.1-2 version of xlrd. 

    Created HISTORY file to document changes.
