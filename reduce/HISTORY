   rlo.py

       Iverted test of __name__ near top of file, so that following 
       code (which is most of the code) could be dedented one level, 
       That led to consolidating some statements onto a single line 
       which had been split across more than one line. 

       Redirected usage() output to standard error.

    rlo.py

        Fixes _possible_ bug. 

        Lines 219-221 has print statements that output only to 
        standard output, although neighboring print statements output 
        to both standard output and log_file via the >>t technique. 
        I do not know that this is a bug, but it smells like one, 
        so I added the ">>t, " stuff to those prints.

    rlo.py

        Simplified printing same stuff to multiple outputs. 
        Instead of having separate print statements for each output, 
        one now has only a single print statement for multiple outputs. 

        For example, the old way:

            print time.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", time.localtime())
            print "user:",os.times()[0],"s"
            print "system:",os.times()[1],"s"
            print >>log_file, time.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", time.localtime())
            print >>log_file, "user:",os.times()[0],"s"
            print >>log_file, "system:",os.times()[1],"s" 

        was simplified to: 

            t=Tee([sys.stdout,log_file])
        ...
            print >>t, time.strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000', 
                time.localtime())
            print >>t, 'user:', os.times()[0], 's'
            print >>t, 'system:', os.times()[1], 's' 

    tee.py

        Created.  Simplifies writing to multiple files. 

        Instead of repeating a print for each file one needs to output to, 
        one uses a single print that redirects to an instance of this class.  

        Inspired by Unix tee program.

2011-07-21 reduce-2.2.0-jep01

    rlo.py

        Refactored code that created reduce_path and image_path 
        directories, and checked to see if those directories are 
        writable. 

        This included the elimination of a redundant test of ability 
        to write to reduce_path directory, which led to big dedent 
        of following code and subsequent unwrapping of some statements 
        which had previously been split across more than one line. 

        Error messages were made more accurate and meaningful. 
        Old error message was about not being able to read, 
        even though the test was about writing to the directory. 
        The error message was changed to be about writing. 

        Catches directory creation error and generates error 
        message and sys.exit()s instead of crashing in Python interpreter. 

        Redirected messages about fatal errors to sys.stderr. 

        Instead of the xlrd-0.7.1 that is bundled with reduce, 
        I used the older version 0.6.1-2 of the python-xlrd package 
        that was avaiable for Bodhi linux 1.1.0. reduce seemed to 
        work with the older 0.6.1-2 version of xlrd. 

    Created HISTORY file to document changes.
